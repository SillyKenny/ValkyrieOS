# OS Files.
this folder is the main folder for all the files, That are not test files, just working files.

# Extra info.
unlike [Tests](https://github.com/SillyKenny/ValkyrieOS/tree/main/Tests) this will just be working/main files that are still in the works but its just the unfinished files. Confusing? Maybe. However it makes sense to me, lol.

Thank you!
