# Tests Folder
This folder is for all my testing. It will include files I may not need later on, so its simply just for testing purposes *only*.

## Testing Folder Sub-Folders.

this folder will have many subfolders. I will list the main ones now.

- Demos
  - This will contain all final files for each **DEMO VERSION**. ie "Ver. 1.0-alpha"
  - All demo versions will be marked with "#.#-alpha".
  - Each demo will have its own folder & readme.
- Working-Files
  - This will contain all the files that are in testing but also the main files.
  - Again each version will have its own folder & readme files.
